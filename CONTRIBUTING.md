## Reporting a bug

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* caused by the code in this repository.
Good bug reports are extremely valuable to us—thank you!

Before opening a bug report:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported
   ([issues](https://github.com/davidpfister/fpx.f/issues)).
2. Check if it is still an issue or it has been fixed?
   Try to reproduce it with the latest version from the default branch.
3. Isolate the problem and create a minimal test case.

A good bug report should include all information needed to reproduce the bug.
Please be as detailed as possible:

1. Which version of _fpm-modules_ are you using? Please be specific.
2. What are the steps to reproduce the issue?
3. What is the expected outcome?
4. What happens instead?

This information will help the developers diagnose the issue quickly and with
minimal back-and-forth.

## Pull request

If you have a suggestion that would make this project better, please create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!
1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/davidpfister/fpx.f/issues/new) to
   describe a bug or propose a new feature.
   Refer to the earlier sections on how to write a good bug report or feature    request.
2. Discuss with the developers and reach consensus about what should be done about the bug or feature request.
   **When actively working on code towards a PR, please assign yourself to the
   issue on GitHub.**
   This is good collaborative practice to avoid duplicated effort and also inform others what you are currently working on.
3. Create your Feature Branch (```git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature```)
4. Commit your Changes (```git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'```)
5. Push to the Branch (```git push origin feature/AmazingFeature```)
6. Open a Pull Request with your contribution.
   The body of the PR should at least include a bullet-point summary of the
   changes, and a detailed description is encouraged.
   If the PR completely addresses the issue you opened in step 1, include in
   the PR description the following line: ```Fixes #<issue-number>```. If your PR implements a feature that adds or changes the behavior of _fpm-modules_,
   your PR must also include appropriate changes to the documentation and associated units tests.

In brief, 
* A PR should implement *only one* feature or bug fix.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix.
* Smaller PRs are better than large PRs, and will lead to a shorter review and
  merge cycle
* Add tests for your feature or bug fix to be sure that it stays functional and useful
* Be open to constructive criticism and requests for improving your code.
